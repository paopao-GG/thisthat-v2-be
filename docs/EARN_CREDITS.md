# How Do People Earn Credits?

This document outlines the various ways users can earn credits in the THISTHAT platform.

## 1. Daily Log-ins

Users can claim daily credits that increase based on their streak amount. The credit amount increases based on the time of claiming. **Important:** The wallet reverts back to the initial amount if the user was not able to claim for 24 hours.

### Examples:
- Day 1: 1000 credits
- Day 2: 1500 credits
- Day 3: 2500 credits

## 2. Betting Earnings

Users can earn credits through successful bets in two ways:

### Examples:
1. **Immediate profit**: The amount they initially invested pumps → sell their shares right away
2. **Market resolution**: They wait for the market to conclude → potentially they win more credits

## 3. Credit Purchases

Users can purchase credits via Stripe or similar payment processor. *(Final feature to implement)*

### Examples:
- We'll have a % cut per transaction made
