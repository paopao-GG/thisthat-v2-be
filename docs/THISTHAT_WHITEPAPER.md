# **THISTHAT WHITEPAPER – Polymarket-Integrated Web3 Prediction Protocol**

A formal Web3 whitepaper detailing the economics, prediction market infrastructure, tokenomics, governance, and ecosystem design of the THISTHAT SocialFi prediction protocol.

# **1\. Abstract**

THISTHAT is a Web3 prediction protocol built on Polymarket’s Builder infrastructure with a mix of SocialFi aspects that later on will allow creators to create their own markets. THISTHAT enables users to participate in prediction markets through a swipe-and-tap-based mobile interface using credits (V1) and real USDC (V2).

This document provides a full explanation of the system’s mechanics, tokenomics, governance, and roadmap.

# **2\. Vision**

To become the default consumer-facing interface for onchain prediction markets by merging Polymarket-level infrastructure with social gaming, attention markets, and creator-driven ecosystems.

# **3\. Market Opportunity**

Prediction markets are growing rapidly, but traditional platforms lack accessible UI/UX. THISTHAT bridges this gap with simple tap and swipe interactions, low-friction credits, and SocialFi loops that make predictions addictive, accessible, and social.

# **4\. Core Concepts**

Prediction Markets – Binary THIS/THAT outcome wagering.

Social Attention Markets – Creator, narrative, cultural, and KOL-driven predictions.

Credits (V1) – Internal currency for user engagement, gameplay, and metrics gathering. Can be acquired through daily log-ins and through in-app purchases.

USDC Markets (V2) – Real money, onchain liquidity via Polymarket Builder API.

$THIS – Used to create creator-driven markets.

Button Tapping – Click on THIS/THAT to choose the option you want to stake after inputting an amount to risk.

Swipe Selection – Swipe up/down to see various random market categories that you can stake your credits/USDC with. This is randomized in order to have a tinder-style vibe where you don’t know what/who’s next.

# **5\. System Architecture**

V1 Credits Layer – Onboarding, non-financial (optional), frictionless.

V2 Polymarket Integration – Real USDC markets, wallets, onchain resolution.

V3 Full Decentralization – THISTHAT TGE \+ token utility, governance, creator staking.

# **6\. Gameplay Loop**

1\. The user opens the app → greeted w/ a landing page before choosing to play.

2\. Users swipes up/down until they see a random market they want to bet on

3\. Adjusts bet size by inputting an amount

4\. Clicking on THIS/THAT to confirm which option they chose to stake bet (confirms automatically)

5\. Earns credits or USDC depending on version.

6\. When a user sells their shares/stock or when the market concludes, it will update the leaderboard (happens from time-to-time).

7\. Users look at other markets again.

8\. Repeat.

# **7\. Tokenomics – THISTHAT Token (Placeholder)**

\- Credits mimic market returns in V1 without regulatory hurdles. For every credit purchase. Our protocol receives a percent cut on every credit bought.

Reward Flywheel:

\- More bets → more fees → more rewards → more engagement.

# **9\. Creator Ecosystem**

Creators launch markets, they can either stake their $THIS tokens or pay an upfront amount equivalent to $THIS (e.g. $100 worth of $THIS), share their launched markets, and earn a % fee on every transaction \+ have a % share when the market concludes. Their followers fuel liquidity and engagement.

# **12\. Roadmap**

Phase 1 – Credits App \= Gathering Metrics

Phase 2 – USDC Polymarket integration \= Volume Farming for $THIS

Phase 3 – Token Generation Event \= Creator-Driven Markets (Utilizing $THIS)

Phase 4 – Full SocialFi ecosystem

# **13\. Risks & Mitigations**

Regulatory – Credits-first model.

# **14\. Conclusion**

THISTHAT merges Polymarket prediction infrastructure with SocialFi mechanics to create the world's most accessible, creator-driven, mobile-first prediction platform.
